# IP Webhook

A simple webhook endpoint built with Node.js and Express that logs visits to a specific link and sends the visitor's IP address to a Discord webhook.

## Features

- Logs visits to a specific link.
- Sends the visitor's IP address to a Discord webhook.
- The URL includes a base64-encoded string for identifying who opened the link.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   `git clone https://github.com/crunny/ip-webhook.git`

2. **Install dependencies:**

   `npm install`

3. **Set up a webhook in Discord:**

   - Go to your Discord server.
   - Choose the channel where you want to receive the notifications.
   - Click on "Edit Channel" (the cogwheel icon) > "Integrations" > "Webhooks" > "New Webhook".
   - Copy the webhook URL generated by Discord.

4. **Create a `.env` file in the project root:**

   `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your_discord_webhook_url_here`

   Replace `your_discord_webhook_url_here` with the actual webhook URL provided by Discord.

5. **Run the application:**

   `npm start`

   This will start the Express server.

6. **Test the webhook:**

Once the server is running, visit the webhook endpoint (`http://localhost:PORT/?u=base64_encoded_string`) in your browser, replacing `PORT` with the port number where your server is running and `base64_encoded_string` with the base64 encoded string representing any additional information you want to include in the Discord message.

### Customizable URL

You must include a base64-encoded string as a query parameter `u` at the end of the URL to customize the behaviour of the webhook. This encoded string will be decoded and used to indicate who opened the URL in the Discord webhook message. For example:

`https://your.site/api/webhook?u=dGVzdF91c2Vy`

In this example, the base64-encoded string `dGVzdF91c2Vy` represents the text "test_user" when decoded.
The Discord webhook message will include a section indicating that the URL was opened by "test_user".
